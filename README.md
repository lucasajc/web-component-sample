# Web Component Sample

## Introduction

This web component sample, `src/components/filmCard`, displays Star Wars opening crawls (those letters present on every movie of the franchise) everytime the user clicks on a specific button. The element keeps the state of the component, knowing if the display is opened or closed applying the matching CSS for each situation. 

The Star Wars data is collected from the [SWAPI (Star Wars API)](https://swapi.co/).
